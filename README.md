# Lona Serialization

Convert Lona files between XML, JSON, and source code (Swift + MDX).

## Overview

Lona token files are typically stored as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown with React components).

Token files support a special kind of code block, marked with the language "tokens", that contains Lona token definitions. These definitions can be stored as XML, JSON, or (a small subset of) Swift.
